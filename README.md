**Summary**

We used electronic health records and machine learning to generate an in-silico score for coronary artery disease (ISCAD) that captures disease progression, severity and underdiagnosis (see. https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(22)02079-7). Rare and ultra-rare coding variants in the exome-sequences of 464,416 UK Biobank participants were then tested for association with ISCAD. This revealed single variant and gene-level associations in 11 new genes. Further associations of these genes with clinical biomarkers reveal known and novel biological mechanisms associated with coronary artery disease.

Here we provide public access to the code used to generate ISCAD (ISCAD.R) and test rare variants for association with ISCAD (association_tests.sh).

For further details about the methods and analysis behind this study, please see our paper: Petrazzini, BO et al. Machine learning-based marker for coronary artery disease identifies rare coding variants in 11 new genes. Submitted.

Summary statistics for single variant, gene-level and biomarker associations will be made available upon publication.
